# Capstone-project---Conference-page

In my first Capstone project I have done the following:

1. Personalize the content of your page. 
2. Choose a different topic from the one in the original design.
3. Follow these [design guidelines](https://www.behance.net/gallery/29845175/CC-Global-Summit-2015), including:

- Colors.
- Typography: font face, size, and weight.
- Layout: composition and space between elements.

4. The pages should look almost identical to the original design. Small adjustments like text or image changes are acceptable.
5. Build only these 2 pages:
- The home page.
- The about page.

Each of these pages have versions for 2 different screen sizes:
- Mobile: up to 768px wide.
- Desktop: 768px or wider.

6. Interactions

- Links

The home page has a link to the about page in the menu.
The logo in the header links to the home page.

- Mobile menu

- When the user clicks (or taps) the hamburger button on the header, the mobile menu appears over the page.
- **There are no guidelines for the mobile menu in the docs, but you should implement it so it is consistent with the design (colors, typography, spacings, etc.).**
- The mobile menu has a close (X) button that closes the menu.

7. Dynamic page

- The section "Featured speakers" has been created dynamically in JavaScript.
- Use a JavaScript variable with the data about the speakers and use it when the page loads to create the HTML for this section dynamically.
